While Boosted doesn't include an icon set by default, Orange does have its own comprehensive icon library called Solaris.

While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Solaris

Solaris is a growing library of SVG icons that are designed by [Orange's Global Design Language Team](https://design.orange.com/).

They are not open-source though and should only be used for Orange branded projects. Please refer to our [`NOTICE.txt` file for legal informations]({{< param repo >}}/blob/v{{< param current_version >}}/NOTICE.txt).
