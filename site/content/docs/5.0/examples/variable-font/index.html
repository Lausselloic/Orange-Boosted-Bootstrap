        Accessibility compliance update
      </h2>

      <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display mb-0">Accessibility standards are key for any Orange digital product and service. There are colour pairing recommendations and accessibility guidance in place, however, the particular colour pairing of white text on orange backgrounds has never been satisfactory. Therefore, in order to support Orange accessibility ambition, the typography colour in orange filled buttons is changing to black. This change will now make buttons AAA compliant which is significant progress. In addition, other components such as step process, radio buttons or checkboxes that also have an association of white labels or graphics on an orange background are also impacted by this change.</p>

    <h2 class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-text-bold h4 mt-5 mb-2">The Orange Web UI</h2>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">The Orange Web UI includes the user interface components that convey meaning and provide functionality to users in order to interact with the underlying system. Those are organized in five branches: buttons, forms, navigation, alerts and tables. The kit does not limit to those elements and includes as well all graphical assets that will help creating a web responsive page that is entirely compliant with the Brand identity and the Web Browsing guidelines: logos, color palette, typography text styles organized by type of devices types (mobile, tablet, desktops), layout grids, as well as key modules such as headers, footers, navigation menus and search bar.</p>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">Relying on such a kit to design web pages means benefiting from many advantages. It helps to streamline and accelerate the design process. It is an efficient way to save time and money because it allows to free up creative energy and resources to focus on creating what does not already exist. It is a major opportunity to learn and solve common problems at once by leveraging on a number of detailed variants that will help cover simple and complex uses cases. Last, such a cloud distributed kit is the insurance that every single piece of design is always up to date according to the latest changes or additions.</p>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">In the end, using a such a kit is an easy and effective way to ensure the consistency of the style across the various web assets, which undoubtedly increase consistency of the user experience.</p>

    <h2 class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-text-bold h4 mt-5 mb-2">Design Kits, Design System and Orange Global Design Language</h2>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">Design Systems are a growing and evolving space. However, they are becoming a common practice among most companies and public institutions creating and offering digital products or services; some Design Systems being publicly available online on websites such as <a href="https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems">Design System Repo</a> or <a href="https://adele.uxpin.com/">Adele on UX Pin</a>.</p>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">Design System can vary in scope, scale and composition according to the needs and nature of a business. A Design System is a single source of interconnected elements and shared practices that enable the design and creation of digital products.</p>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">Design Systems already exist at Orange; they exist independently and have been created to serve the needs of their individual projects. However, many elements of these independent systems are common across a wide range of Orange digital products. A core aim of Orange Global Design Language team is a unified Design System that shares these common elements, providing many benefits including increased efficiency, economy and consistency. Orange Design System is comprised of Design Kits, documentation such as Guidelines, and code.</p>

    <h2 class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-text-bold h4 mt-5 mb-2">Sketch, Libraries and Cloud </h2>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">Sketch has now become one of the most important interface tools for designing digital products. As a design tool Sketch uses libraries to share and distribute UI components. Libraries are stored on the Sketch Cloud, and once installed, can be accessed directly from within Sketch. Updates including the addition of new text styles or components can be pushed directly from the cloud to Sketch, meaning designers will automatically receive new icons directly. A single library can be used by multiple design teams to create consistent and efficient designs with no need to recreate common elements for each product.</p>

    <h3 class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-text-bold h4 mt-5 mb-2">Not using Sketch?</h3>

    <p class="hn-for-orange-var-w05-regular-display">Donâ€™t worry, Sketch is just one format for Orange Design Kits. <a href="https://design.orange.com/libraries/web-ui-adobe">UI components remains available in AI and PSD formats</A>.</p>
