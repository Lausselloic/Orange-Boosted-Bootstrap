<!-- Boosted mod: using visually hidden text instead of aria-label -->

**Be sure to include helpful text for screen readers**, including some context â€” as we've done using [`.sr-only` utility]({{< docsref "/utilities/screen-readers" >}}), or, as a last resort, as [Bootstrap does with `aria-label`]({{< param bootstrap >}}/docs/{{< param docs_version >}}/utilities/close-icon/).


{{< example >}}
<button type="button" class="close">
    <span class="sr-only">Close this component</span>
</button>
{{< /example >}}
