# Migrating from Boosted

This guide provides information on how to migrate from Boosted (latest release) to OUDS Web.

## Fonts

OUDS Web doesn't use the Helvetica Neue font. Instead, it uses the system font stack. This means that the font will be different depending on the operating system and browser being used.

Technically, it means that you can get rid of the following things:
- Helvetica Neue woff2 files: `fonts/HelvNeue55_W1G.woff2`, `fonts/HelvNeue75_W1G.woff2`, `fonts/HelveticaNeueW20-55Roman.woff2`, and `fonts/HelveticaNeueW20-75Bold.woff2`.
- `orange-helvetica.*.css` file (default, RTL, or minified version).
- If you were customizing your Sass compilation, you can remove the `@import "orange-helvetica";` line from your Sass files if it was there.
